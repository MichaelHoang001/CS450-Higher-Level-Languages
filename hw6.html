Due Sunday, April 3 at 11:59 PM (collected electronically).
</b>
<p>This assignment consists of reading, understanding, and modifying the
metacircular evaluator in Chapter 4 of Abelson and Sussman.  The
assignment has lots of pieces. Be sure you start early. Moreover, some
of the things you need to do are more subtle than you may first think.</p>

<p>Copy file ~offner/cs450/hw6/s450.scm to your <tt>hw6</tt> subdirectory.  That
file contains all the relevant code from A&S, with small changes so that it runs
in UMB Scheme.  The name of the evaluator has been changed to <tt>s450</tt>.
The invoking function is now <tt>(s450)</tt>, not <tt>(driver-loop)</tt>.  This
is the file we have been discussing in class.</p>

<p>You will create two files (which I will collect):
<ul>
<li> <tt>s450.scm</tt> This will be the (commented) scheme code that
you write.  It will be an edited version of the original
<tt>s450.scm</tt>.</li>

<li> <tt>notes.txt</tt> This is for more discursive comments and
discussion about the decisions you made in implementing the code for
these problems, how you tested the code, and anything else that might
be relevant.</li>
</ul>

<div id="narrow_emph_border">

  <b>IMPORTANT: Testing your code will be crucial.  Test everything as you build
  it.  Do not wait till you have finished coding the assignment to start
  testing.  Keep careful notes.  You will undoubtedly be surprised by some
  things, or have difficulty understanding what is going on in some cases.  You
  should report all of this in <tt>notes.txt</tt>.</b></p>

</div>

<ol>

<li>(You should have already done this.) Play with the s450
evaluator:

<pre>
% scheme s450.scm
==> (s450)
s450==> ...
</pre>
or
<pre>
% scheme
==> (load "s450.scm")
==> (s450) 
s450==> ...
</pre>
See how much of real Scheme is there. Write (in <tt> notes.txt</tt>)
about what you found.</li>

<li><p>Rewrite <tt>xeval</tt> so that the handling of special forms is data
directed.  (This is Exercise 4.3 on page 374.)  For each special form
( <tt> lambda</tt>, <tt> set!</tt>, <tt> cond</tt>, <tt> define</tt>,
<tt> quote</tt>, ...  ) there is an appropriate semantic action&#8212;a
scheme procedure A&S have already written.  If you put those actions
in a lookup table keyed by the symbol representing the special form
then the cond in <tt> xeval</tt> will be much shorter, with a single
table lookup for almost all the cases now listed separately.  And you
will be able to add special forms to s450 without editing <tt>
xeval</tt>, which will now look something like this (in pseudocode):</p>

<pre>
   let action = (lookup-action (type-of expression))
       if lookup succeeded
        invoke action, passing it the expression and the environment
        else cond ... ;; check for a few other types of expressions

</pre>

<p>You should write scheme functions like <tt> lookup-action</tt> and
<tt>type-of</tt> to hide the lookup table implementation. (There are
various ways to build a lookup table.  You might want to review
Section 3.3.3 (pages 266--271) for some ideas.)</p>

<p>There's nothing fancy going on here.  And <tt>type-of</tt> is an extremely
simple procedure that just helps to figure out which special form you're dealing
with.  It's very similar to the way the <tt>cond</tt> expression works in the
original <tt>xeval</tt>.  It's that simple.</p>

<p>To insert a new special form in the table write the procedure
<tt> install-special-form</tt> and call it this way (for example):
<pre>
==> (install-special-form 'set! (lambda (exp env) ... ) )
</pre>
</p>

<p>Since <tt> install-special-form</tt> is not a special form in scheme,
its first argument will be evaluated, and therefore generally needs to
be quoted, as in the example above, to prevent this. (Indeed, it is
possible to call <tt>install-special-form</tt> with the first
argument being an unquoted expression that evaluates to the symbol for
the form you are installing.)  The second parameter, <tt>action</tt>, should be
a lambda expression (or something that evaluates to a lambda
expression) that takes <b>two</b> parameters, <tt>exp</tt> and <tt>env</tt>.
<tt>xeval</tt> in s450 will arrange to pass those parameters when
action is called.  Since <tt> install-special-form</tt> is not a
special form, that lambda expression will be evaluated in the
environment in which <tt> install-special-form</tt> is called before
being passed to the body of <tt>install-special-form</tt>.</p>

<p>Since <tt>install-special-form</tt> is called only for its side
effect, it returns no useful information.  However, to avoid
generating garbage, have it return the name of the special form being
installed.</p>

<p>Your implementation should ensure that a new special form cannot be
installed using the name of a variable that is already defined.</p>

<p>Similarly, a special form (that is already in the table) cannot be
"reinstalled" using <tt>install-special-form</tt>.</p>

<!-- <p>Optional: If you can, arrange matters so you can call <tt> -->
<!-- install-special-form</tt> both from the scheme prompt before starting -->
<!-- the s450 interpreter and from inside the s450 interpreter, so that you -->
<!-- can install a new special form in a running interpreter. If you do -->
<!-- this, <tt> install-special-form</tt> must be called exactly the same -->
<!-- way inside as out. (But I will only test calling it with a quoted -->
<!-- first argument.)  It's up to you to decide whether inside s450 <tt> -->
<!-- install-special-form</tt> should be a special form or a primitive -->
<!-- procedure.</p> -->

<p>Once you have written <tt> install-special-form</tt> you can save yourself lots
of time typing at the <tt> s450==></tt> prompt to test your code by installing
<tt> load</tt> as a special form. The code you need is in
~offner/cs450/hw6/load.s450.</p>

<p>If you do this, <b>please</b> include the text of <tt>load.s450</tt>
in your file <tt>s450.scm</tt>.  Don't <tt>(load "load.s450")</tt>.</p>
</li>

<li>In s450 now, entering the name of a special form at the prompt causes
a crash.  Fix things so that instead a message is generated, like
this:
<pre>
        s450==> if
        Special form:  if
</pre>
</li>

<li>Fix things so that the name of a special form cannot be redefined or
assigned to.  That is, we should not be able to get away with typing
<pre>
        s450==> (define if 3)
</pre>
or
<pre>
        s450==> (set! if 3)
</pre>
</li>

<li>Write and install the following new special forms:
<br/>
<center>
<table border cellpadding=8 width=90%>
<tr>
<td>
<tt>(defined? &lt;symbol&gt;)</tt>
</td>
<td>
returns <tt>#t</tt> iff the <tt>&lt;symbol&gt;</tt> is defined in the
current environment.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><tt>(locally-defined? &lt;symbol&gt;)</tt></td>
<td> returns <tt> #t</tt> iff the <tt>&lt;symbol&gt;</tt> is defined in the
first frame of the current environment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><tt> (make-unbound! &lt;symbol&gt;)</tt></td>
<td> removes the <tt>&lt;symbol&gt;</tt> binding(s) from the current
environment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> <tt> (locally-make-unbound! &lt;symbol&gt;)</tt></td>
<td>remove the <tt>&lt;symbol&gt;</tt> binding from the first frame of the
current environment.</td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>(These last two special forms constitute Exercise 4.13 on p. 380 with
the issue raised there resolved.)</p>

<p><tt>locally-make-unbound!</tt> should not report an error if the
<tt>&lt;symbol&gt;</tt> is not locally bound to begin with.  There is just
nothing to do in that case.</p>

<p>Design a way to test these four new special forms. Hint: in order to
create a situation in which the local and global versions of your new
special forms should behave differently, you will have to build some
environments with more than one frame.  The only way to do that from
the s450 prompt is by applying a procedure.  (And see the note above
about loading s450 test files.)  For instance, you might try defining
something like this within s450:</p>
<pre>
   (define f
      (lambda (a b)
        (display (locally-defined? a))
        (display (locally-defined? b))
        (locally-make-unbound! a)
        (locally-make-unbound! b)
        (display (locally-defined? a))
        (display (locally-defined? b))
        )
      ) 
</pre>
<p>and then executing <tt>(f 3 4)</tt>.  What should happen?  And there are more
complex expressions you could create.  You should do that as well.</p>
</li>

<li>Clean up the way primitive procedures are installed in s450:  write a
procedure <tt>install-primitive-procedure</tt> that can be called like
this:
<pre>
         (install-primitive-procedure <code><</code>name<code>></code>  <code><</code>action<code>></code>)
</pre>
For instance,
<pre>
         (install-primitive-procedure 'car car)
</pre>
<p>This procedure should insert the definition of the primitive procedure
directly in the global environment.  Make sure that it is impossible
to reuse the name of a special form for the name of a primitive
procedure.</p>

<p>Note that as before, since install-primitive-procedure is not a
special form, the name generally needs to be quoted.</p>

<p>As in the case of <tt>install-special-form</tt>, this procedure is
called purely for its side effect, so it does not return a useful
value.  However, to avoid generating a lot of garbage, have it return
the name of the primitive procedure being installed.</p>

<div id="narrow_emph_border">

  <p><font color=red><b>This is important!</b></font> After you have done this,
  change the startup code so that all the primitive procedures are created by
  calls to <tt>install-primitive-procedure</tt>.  <b>And then be sure to delete
  the original code that defined the primitive procedures.</b>  So in
  particular, you should not have the variables

  <pre>
     primitive-procedures
     primitive-procedure-names
     primitive-procedure-objects
  </pre>

  in your code.  Please make sure they are no longer in your code; I'm going to
  check for that.</p>

  <p> If you don't understand what I mean here, please get in touch with me.
  This is a small thing you need to do, but if you don't do it, my tests just
  won't work.</p>

</div>

<p>Then install <tt>+</tt> and some other scheme procedures of your choice as
primitive procedures in s450. Note that a primitive procedure in s450 does not
have to be primitive in the underlying scheme.</p> </li>

</ol>

Some Friendly Warnings
</center></b>
<ul>
<li> My testing script relies heavily on <tt>install-special-form</tt>
and <tt>install-primitive-procedure</tt>.  So you have to make sure
that you have implemented them.  If you haven't, I won't be able to
test your code.  <b><font color=red>This is important.  I don't care how good the
rest of your code is.  If these two procedures don't work, nothing
else will make sense.</font>  If you need help, ask me for it, and please ask
early.</b></li>

<li> <p>You will be making extensive changes to the file <tt>s450.scm</tt>;
please make frequent backups, and make sure your code is clean and
understandable.  This is by no means a trivial matter of last-minute cleanups:
you will probably end up moving large amounts of code from one part of the file
to another, and introducing whole new sections of code.  Your code (and your
<tt>notes.txt</tt> file) has to be written so that

<ul>
<li> You can understand it now.</li>
<li> I can understand it now.</li>
<li> You will be able to understand it in six months.  (And don't kid
yourself:  this is a stringent test.)</li>
</ul></p>

<p> You will be using your code as the starting code for the next assignment
(Yes! I really meant that!), so it has to be absolutely clearly written.</p>

<p> And to say again something I've said before: when you write this code (and
these notes), don't imagine that you are the student and I am the teacher.
Instead, imagine that you are a senior programmer in some company who has
developed this code, and that you are about to move on to a different project.
Imagine that I am a junior programmer who has just been hired to take over your
code.  I don't understand very much about it (or anything else) at all, and the
only thing I have to go by is the notes and comments that you have written, as
well as the code itself, which therefore also has to be clear and
well-formatted.</p></li>
