<b>CS 450 Homework 1</b><br/>
Bill Campbell*<br/>
Spring 2016<br/>

<p>*due to Carl Offner, from a similar assignment due to Prof. Bolker.</p>

<br/>
<b>Part I. Due Wednesday, January 27, in class.</b>

<ol>
  <li>Apply for a department Unix account in the usual way.
  Do that even if you already have a Unix account, so that
  you can tell the system that you are enrolled in this course.
  Do not <b>ever</b> change the protections on this account (or on any
  files or subdirectories in it).</li>

  <li>Read pages 1-21 of the text (Abelson and Sussman's Structure and
  Interpretation of Computer Programs) once over lightly, and try not to worry
  about what doesn't seem clear.  Answer the following 4 exercises (and note
  that the third one has a number of parts to it):</li>

  <ol>
    <li> 1.1 (page 20)  Work this out with pencil and paper, thinking it through by
    yourself <b>before</b> you run Scheme to see what it really does.  Then evaluate
    these expressions in Scheme to make sure you got them right. </li>

<!--
    <li> 1.4 (page 21) I'm looking for an answer here that tells me more than "first
    do this, then do that".  I know how to read code; you don't have to tell me.
    What I want to know is this: what's the point of this function?  What does it
    really do?  What would you use it for?  Something like that.</li>
-->

<!-- moved from part 2 in 2009 -->
    <li> 1.6 (page 25). Note that this exercise calls for an 
    explanation, not a program.</li>

    <li> (Call this <b>Problem A</b> on your paper, so I'll know which one it
    is.) Suppose we have this code: 
<pre>
    (define (f x) (* x x))
</pre>
    <ol>
      <li> What is this turned into internally when the Scheme interpreter reads
      this definition?</li>

      <li> Given this definition, and given the following expression
  <pre>
       (f (+ 3 5))
  </pre>
      <ol>
        <li> Show how this expression is evaluated using applicative-order
        evaluation.</li>
        <li> Show how this expression is evaluated using normal-order
        evaluation.</li>
      </ol>
    </ol>

    <li> For extra credit: 1.5 (page 21).</li>
    <!-- end of the two items moved in 2009 -->

  </ol>
</ol>

<p>To test your answers and your understanding you will want to be able
to play with Scheme while you read the text.  To run the UMB Scheme
interpreter simply type</p>

<pre>
	% scheme
</pre>

<p>at the Unix prompt. Then enjoy.</p>

<p>To work with a file of Scheme code rather than simply typing at the
Scheme prompt you can redirect input (and output) with</p>

<pre>
	% scheme < somefile.scm > somefile.out
</pre>

<p>or <tt>(load "somefile.scm")</tt> while in Scheme.</p>

<p><b> Note:</b> Your answers to the exercises should come along with (or
be incorporated in) a short essay in which you discuss what you
discovered about Scheme. How does it compare to other languages you
know? Did any of its responses surprise you? What is the largest
integer Scheme will handle?  What message appears when you type '+' at
the Scheme prompt (and what does the message mean)? What other
experiments did you perform?  What do you like or dislike (so far)
about Scheme?</p>

<p>This essay and the others I will regularly ask for are an
important part of how you learn, and an important part of your
grade. I usually read them <b>before</b> I read your code. So take
them seriously.</p>

</ol>

<br/>
<p><b>Part II. Due Monday, February 1, 5:00 PM.</b> <br/>(Collected
electronically.)</p>

<p>When your application for a Unix account for this course was
processed, a <tt>cs450</tt> subdirectory of your home directory was
created for you. You are to do all your work for this course there. Do
not <b>ever</b> change the protections on this directory (or on any
files or subdirectories in it).</p>

<p>Create a 
<tt>hw1</tt> subdirectory of your <tt>cs450</tt> directory. Do your
work for this assignment there.</p>

<p>Emacs knows about Scheme. It edits files with the <tt>.scm</tt> extension in
<tt>Scheme mode</tt>. In that mode, the <tt>tab</tt> key will indent code
correctly.  If you are not an emacs user you should definitely learn that editor
now. It's much more powerful than vi; that power will save you lots of
programming time.</p>

<p>One of the reasons I'm making a big point of this is that your code needs to
be indented properly so that it can be understood.  I (and the grader as well)
have to be able to read your code and understand it.  If the indentation is
messed up, I can't do this, and I will definitely take off points.  I'm not
trying to be mean about this.  This is just an important thing that you have to
be able to do.</p>

<p>And by the way, I occasionally have students who try to do their work in
Microsoft Word and then somehow turn it back into plain text.  They end up
wasting an incredible amount of time doing this, and their work looks like a
mess.  Don't fall into this trap.  Use emacs, and if you need help, just ask me,
or send me email.</p>

<p>Rapidly read through the Scheme language report ("Revised<sup>5</sup>
Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme"; this is usually referred
to as "R5RS"). Do not try to learn everything that's there. Skip all
the hard parts. Use this reading to learn the kinds of things that can
be found there, so you can look things up when you need to.</p>

<p>Put the answers to the exercises listed below in a file named <font
color=blue><tt>ASanswers.txt</tt></font> in your <tt>hw1</tt> directory.  Your
answers should be written out in complete paragraphs. Your work should be
sufficiently self contained so that three months from now you will be able to
look at them and understand them without having to go back to the book to see
what the question was, or the point of the question.</p>

<p>This file should be a plain ASCII text file.  You will have to rely on white
space for formatting. I am not going to deal with any files that contain extra
or hidden formatting characters, whether it is Microsoft Word or HTML.  And
please make sure that all your lines in this file are 80 characters or less in
length.  If you put this line</p>

<pre>
    (setq-default fill-column 80)
</pre>

<p> in your <tt>&#126;/.emacs</tt> file, this will help you.  But you still have
to make sure that your lines haven't run over.  (And yes, I really mean this.
I'm taking off points if lines run over.  If you don't know what I mean, ask me
or send me email.)</p>

<p>Remember that unix file names are case sensitive.  Here are three file
names that are incorrect:</p>
<ul>
<li> <tt>asanswers.txt</tt> <font color=red>WRONG!</font></li>
<li> <tt>ASanswer.txt</tt> <font color=red>WRONG!</font></li>
<li> <tt>ASanswers.doc</tt> <font color=red>WRONG!</font></li>
</ul>
<p>Do you see what is wrong with each of them?  If you name your file
even slightly incorrectly, my collecting script will not find it, and
I will never see your homework.  <em>It is not my responsibility to go
rummaging around in your directory to try to figure out what you have
named your files.</em>  So please be careful with filenames.  It will
save us both a lot of grief.</p>

<p>Here are the exercises you should do:</p>
<ol>
<!-- moved to part 1 in 2009
  <li> 1.6 (page 25). Note that this exercise calls for an 
  explanation, not a program.</li>
-->

<!--
  <li> 1.9 (page 36). You have to justify your answer in each case.  Please
  write clearly.  A good way to tell if you have answered this question correctly
  is this: would you understand it if someone else explained it to you this way?
  That's the way I'm going to judge it, anyway.</li>
-->

  <li> 1.11 (page 42). Be sure to discuss how you tested your
  procedure.</li>

  <li> 1.12 (page 42).  To be precise, let us define the function <tt>p</tt>
  for "Pascal" which takes two arguments:
  <pre>
  r -- the row number
  e -- the element number in the row
  </pre>
  So <tt>(p r e)</tt> is the value of element <tt>e</tt> in
  row <tt>r</tt>.  And we number the rows starting from 0, and we also number
  the elements in each row starting from 0.  (That is the usual convention.)
  Thus for instance,
  <pre>
  (p 0 0) evaluates to 1
  (p 2 1) evaluates to 2
  (p 4 2) evaluates to 6
  </pre>
  and so on.  The problem then is to write a recursive Scheme procedure for the
  function <tt>p</tt>.
 </li>

<!--
  <li> For extra credit: 1.16 (page 46). Be sure to discuss design
  and testing.</li>
-->

  <li> For extra credit: 1.17 (page 46).  Be sure to discuss design and
  testing.</li>

<!-- moved to part 1 in 2009
  <li> For extra credit: 1.5 (page 21).</li>
-->
</ol>

And when I say, "Be sure to discuss design and testing", I really mean it.  You
should be able to write something interesting and meaningful, and it should be
longer than just a few sentences.  If you can't think of anything to write, then
you probably haven't thought enough about these problems.  In any case, please
do feel free to contact me by email with any questions.
