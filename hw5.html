<p>These exercises concern streams and delayed evaluation, and provide some
practice using them in a remarkable and non-trivial example&#8212;computing the
decimal digits of &pi;.</p>
                                

<p>Put your answers to these problems in the file <tt>pi.scm</tt> in
your <tt>hw5</tt> directory.  This file should begin with some
definitions from the textbook, which are included <a
href="pi_header.scm">here</a>.  You should <b>copy</b> these
definitions into the top of your file <tt>pi.scm</tt> (in addition to
any other definitions you might find useful before starting the code
for the various problems below).  This is important: <tt>pi.scm</tt>
should not load any other file&#8212;it should be a self-contained file
that contains any code it needs.</p>

<p>Also, you should create a separate text file <tt>notes.txt</tt> to hold more
extended discussions of the problems and the code you wrote.  (Of course, the
code should still be commented in place.)</p>

<p>If you use DrRacket for development, then you will find that
<tt>cons-stream</tt> is not pre-defined for you.  Here's what you do:  put the
following code at the top of your file:

<pre>
(define-syntax cons-stream
  (syntax-rules ()
    ((cons-stream head tail)
     (cons head (delay tail)))))
</pre>

<b>But please be careful:</b>  This code does <b>not</b> work under UMB Scheme.
So before you pass your paper in, please comment out this code.  Otherwise your
entire paper won't work.  (In any case, you want to be sure you check your work
with UMB Scheme, so if you have forgotten to do this, you will discover it this way.)</p>

<p>There are five problems in this assignment.  The first three are fairly short
and relatively easy.  The last two are each long and difficult.  They are based
on an expository paper that you will find on my web
site: <a href="http://www.cs.umb.edu/~offner/files/pi.pdf">Computing the Digits
in &pi;</a>.  Actually, all you really need to read in that paper is Section 8,
although you may be interested in looking at other parts as well But you will
really need to read and understand all of Section 8.  (Well, you don't actually
have to completely follow the two proofs in Sections 8.1.1 and 8.2.3, but you
should at least read over those two sections to get an understanding of what is
going on.)</p>

<p>Section 8 of the paper is adapted from the paper ``Unbounded Spigot Algorithms
for the Digits of Pi'', by Jeremy Gibbons, in the American Mathematical Monthly
(Vol. 113, Number 4; April 2006).</p>

<p>Please note: nowhere in the code for this assignment do you need to
use <tt>set!</tt> or any other operator that changes the value of a variable.
Sometimes informally, I write in the paper of "changing the value" of some
variable.  What that always really means is a recursive call in which the new
value is passed.  But no variable actually changes its value.</p>

<p>Please be careful about this.  The whole point of this assignment is to use
streams and recursion.  If you read what I have written here carefully and do
what I suggest, I think you will be amazed at how simple and clear the code for
these procedures is.</p>

<ol>
<li>
Define a function

<pre>
(display-n stream n)
</pre>

that prints the first <tt>n</tt> elements of <tt>stream</tt>, each on
a separate line.

<li> Exercise 3.50 (page 324)

<p>This exercise is pretty simple, provided you follow the suggestion in
the book.  In fact, if you want, you can forget about checking for the
empty stream&#8212;we will only use this procedure for infinite streams.</p>
  
<p>After you get this working (and test it), you should answer the
following questions:</p>
  
<ol>
<li>  What is the purpose of the <tt>apply</tt> and the
<tt>cons</tt> in the last two lines of the procedure?  Why could you
not just leave them out and replace the last two lines by the line

<pre>
       (stream-map proc (map <code><</code>??<code>></code>
       argstreams))))
</pre>

<li> What about replacing the last two lines by this:

<pre>
       (apply stream-map proc (map <code><</code>??<code>></code>
       argstreams))))
</pre>

</ol>

<p>Please note: I'm not asking for answers such as "It works", or "It doesn't
  work".  I'm looking for explanations.  And the explanations have to be
  correct.  In the past, I have had students write things that not only were
  wrong, but that they could easily have seen were wrong if they had just tried
  them out.</p>

<p> A good answer to this question will take some careful explaining.  And what
  I wrote in an earlier assignment still holds: any explanation you give about
  how Scheme works has to be based explicitly on the Scheme language definition
  R5RS.  If it isn't, then the explanation is almost certainly wrong.</p>

<li>
As explained in section 3.5.2, we can define an infinite stream of
ones and use this to define the stream of positive integers:

<pre>
(define ones (cons-stream 1 ones))

(define integers (cons-stream 1 (add-streams ones integers)))
</pre>

<p>Type in these definitions and verify that they work by using the
<tt>display-n</tt> procedure.  Generate the stream <tt>notdiv-235</tt>
of all integers that are not divisible by any of the numbers 2, 3, or
5.  (Use <tt>stream-filter</tt>.)</p>

<li> Read all of Section 8.1 of the paper.

<ol>

<li> Before actually writing any code, finish filling in the table of
  Figure 18.  (Put your table in <tt>notes.txt</tt>.)

<li> Produce a function <tt>mult-stream</tt>, based on the explanation in
  Section 8.1, that takes as input two arguments:

<ul>

<li> The first argument is a multiplier <tt>m</tt>, which is a positive integer.

<li> The second argument is a stream <tt>strm</tt> of digits, representing the
  digits in the decimal representation of a number between 0 and 1.  You may
  assume that the number does not end in an infinite string of 9's.
</ol>

<p>The function <tt>mult-stream</tt> produces a stream which is the decimal
representation of the product of <tt>m</tt> with the number represented
by <tt>strm</tt>.  Don't worry about where the decimal point goes for this
assignment.  (Of course, in practice that would be very important!  It's not at
all hard to figure out, but it's not what I'm concerned about right here.)</p>

<p>Somewhere in the course of doing this, you will probably need a function which
you might want to name

<pre>
    number->list-of-digits
</pre>

which takes a non-negative integer as input and returns the list of single
digits that make up the decimal representation of that integer.  There are
various ways to do this.  One way is to use some of the built-in
Scheme functions that operate on strings and characters, such as

<pre>
    number->string
    string->list
    char->integer
</pre>

If you do this, please be sure to notice that <tt>char->integer</tt> returns the
ASCII value of a character, so if the character is "3", for instance, what is
returned from <tt>char->integer</tt> is not the number 3.  So you'll have to
adjust for that as well.</p>

<li> Read all of Section 8.2 of the paper.

<ol>

<li> <p>On page 54, just before Section 8.2.1, it is stated that we could have
  performed the sequence of computations there, but starting with a value
  different from 2 and still got the same result (in the limit, of course).  Do
  the computations starting with 3 instead of 2 and show that this seems to be
  true.  (This isn't a proof, of course, right?)  Put this in
  <tt>notes.txt</tt>.</p>

  <p> And just to be completely clear about this:  when I talk about "starting
  with 3 instead of 2", I'm talking about replacing only the rightmost 2 in the
  expressions, not all of them.</p>
  

<li> Answer the following question (in <tt>notes.txt</tt>): What is the matrix
  corresponding to the fractional linear transformation that takes x as input,
  adds 3 to it, and then takes the reciprocal of the result?

<li> In the middle of page 55 is a statement that you are invited to try to
  prove.  Put your proof in <tt>notes.txt</tt>

<li> Finally, based on what you have learned in this section, write a Scheme
  procedure named pi, which takes no arguments, and which returns the stream of
  decimal digits of &pi;; that is, the stream (3 1 4 1 5 9 ...).

  <div id="narrow_emph_border">
  
  <p>Please be careful.  I want you to produce a <b><font
  color=red>procedure</font></b> named pi, not a stream named pi.  The
  procedure, when invoked, should produce a stream.</p>

  </div>


<p>To do this, you will need to have a representation for a 2x2 matrix.  A
  simple list of 4 elements will do.  Write a constructor and selectors for
  this.</p>
  
<p>You will also need a procedure to multiply matrices.  I suggest calling this
  procedure <tt>compose</tt>, since "multiply" is overloaded enough as it
  is.</p>
  
<p>You will need to produce the original input stream.  For a hint on how to do
  this, look at how we produced the stream <tt>integers</tt> using
  <tt>add-stream</tt>.  You will need to notice how each element of the stream
  is produced from the previous one: you just add the matrix

<pre>
                   |  1  4  |
                   |        |
                   |  0  2  |
</pre>
  
  to each element of the stream to get the next one.  (Make sure you understand
  this.)  Just as the stream <tt>integers</tt> was produced from the initial
  stream <tt>ones</tt>, you can build up the stream <tt>strm</tt> by starting
  with the stream all of whose elements are this matrix, and you can construct
  this stream in turn the same way as the stream <tt>ones</tt> was
  constructed.</p>

<p>That should enable you to produce <tt>strm</tt> recursively.  (You'll also
  need a procedure to add matrices.  Remember that you add matrices by adding
  corresponding elements.)</p>

<li>In doing this assignment, you should not use floating-point computations.
   And in fact there is no need to, because the only thing you really need to
   deal with is integers.  In such a case, integer operations are both faster
   and more accurate (because they are exact).  So in particular, you don't need
   to use either of the functions <tt>/</tt> or <tt>floor</tt>.  In fact, <pre>
   (quotient a b) </pre> is just the floor of <tt>a/b</tt>.  Isn't that
   neat?</li>

</ol>

The file <tt>notes.txt</tt>

<p> Finally, a word about your <tt>notes.txt</tt> file.  I have asked some
questions above, and I expect to see the answers in that file.  However, if that
is all you put in that file, I will be very disappointed.  You don't want me to
be disappointed.  I expect that you will learn a lot by doing this assignment.
I expect you to write about that in notes.txt.</p>

<p>Believe it or not, I have occasionally seen things like this:</p>

<p><em>"I was confused at first.  But then I thought about it a lot, and now I
understand it."</em></p>

<p>I hope you understand that this sort of thing is useless.  It doesn't tell me
or anyone else anything at all.  Please spend some serious time making your
<tt>notes.txt</tt> file informative and useful.</p> </html>
