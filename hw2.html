<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Spring 2016</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">*Due entirely to Professor Carl Offner. Of course, I am responsible for any errors.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Due Tuesday, February 9, 11:59 PM</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I will collect all work electronically at 11:59 PM on the day it is due. So be sure it is in the proper directory at that time.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Put your answers in file ASanswers.scm in your new hw2 directory .../cs450/hw2, with discussion when required as Scheme comments. (A Scheme comment starts with a semicolon and continues to the end of the line.) I will load and test your file, so be sure that</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<ol class="ol1">
  <li class="li5"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s3">It's bug free.</span></li>
  <li class="li5"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s3">Anything (such as an explanation that you might write) that is not Scheme code is commented, so the Scheme interpreter does not attempt to evaluate it. In particular, anything that isn't yet working should be a stub or a comment.</span></li>
</ol>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">And just to be clear on this: if your file does not load into UMB Scheme without errors, neither I nor the grader will even look at it—and that will be true for every assignment. Neither of us has time to fix that kind of bug. If you are having difficulty, you need to send me email before you pass in the homework, and preferably, the earlier the better.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Also please make sure that</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li5"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s3">None of your lines is more than 80 characters long. I plan to enforce this—you have been warned.</span></li>
  <li class="li5"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s3">You have spelled things correctly. You can use a spell-checker to help with this.</span></li>
  <li class="li5"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s3">There are no spurious control characters in your code or any other text you write. If you use Emacs, this will not be a problem. If you use some Microsoft software, it probably will be a problem.</span></li>
  <li class="li5"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s3">You have Unix line endings, not Microsoft line endings. Use dos2unix if you're not sure.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Finally, a word of warning. Some people have posted answers to some of the problems from the book on the web. I strongly suggest that you not look for them and not use them. The reason is simple: whether those answers are right or wrong, you won't learn a thing. I know this. I've seen it happen. And I can guarantee that you won't find solutions to later assignments on the web, and if you have't learned this material, and learned it well, you won't pass this course. I'm happy to help you myself. I'm happy to have you get help from other students and other places, provided you acknowledge that help. I'm not at all happy to have you copy answers from anyone else or anyplace else, under any circumstance.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The purpose of the following problems is to become familiar with the quote special form, and to learn to think recursively about lists and to use the list primitives of Scheme: cons, car and cdr.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<ol class="ol1">
  <li class="li5"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s3">Write a Scheme procedure is-list? that tests to see if an object is or is not a list, according to the definition of a list in the Scheme language definition. (Where is this definition? OK, I'll tell you: it's on page 25, in Section 6.3.2, which is titled "Pairs and lists". It's the second paragraph in that section.)<br>
Note: UMB Scheme already contains a built-in function list? that does this, and is written so cleverly that it works on cyclic data structures. Please write your own procedure, however; you may assume that the argument passed to it is not cyclic. (And if you don't know what "cyclic" means in this context, don't worry about it.)</span></li>
  <li class="li5"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s3">Exercise 2.55 (page 145). Also answer the following question: why does </span><span class="s4"><b>(car 'abracadabra)</b></span><span class="s3"> not evaluate to </span><span class="s4"><b>quote</b></span><span class="s3">. Let me give you a word of warning about this problem, as well as other problems of this sort: I find that many students taking this class are confused about what a definition is. So for instance in class, I gave you a definition of the "quote" special form. I have found in the past that a lot of students don't take this definition very seriously. They come up with their own understanding of this special form, which sometimes works and sometimes doesn't. The point of the definition that I gave in class was to tell you exactly how that special form works. If you are not using that definition in your answer, then almost certainly your answer is incorrect.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; So if I mark your answer wrong, go back and read this again.</span></li>
  <li class="li5"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s3">Exercise 2.18 (page 103). Call your procedure my-reverse. Now that you know about quote you can test with more than lists of integers.</span></li>
  <li class="li5"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s3">Exercise 2.20 (page 104). (And remember what you learn in this exercise! You'll use it later in this course.)</span></li>
  <li class="li5"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s3">Exercise 2.21 (page 106).</span></li>
  <li class="li5"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s3">Exercise 2.23 (page 107). Call your procedure my-for-each.</span></li>
  <li class="li5"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s3">Do exercises 2.24, 2.25, and 2.26 (page 110), and also 2.53 (page 144), but don't turn in the answers.<br>
Note: Many students (and I know you are all pressed for time) figure this means they can just skip these exercises. Of course I won't know if you don't do them. But I guarantee that you will need to understand these four exercises for a lot of the code that you will be writing in future assignments. So please be sure to do these and take them seriously. And if you don't understand something, please ask me.</span></li>
  <li class="li5"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s3">Exercise 2.27 (page 110). Call your procedure my-deep-reverse.</span></li>
  <li class="li5"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s3">Exercise 2.54 (page 145), with the following change: in the statement of the problem, substitute eqv? for eq?. This makes the definition closer to the Scheme language definition. (In fact, it would be even better to substitute "pair" for "list" in the recursive definition given in the problem. You can do this.) Call your procedure my-equal?.</span></li>
  <li class="li2"><span class="s5"></span><span class="s1">Define a procedure every? which takes two formal parameters:</span></li>
  <ul class="ul2">
    <li class="li5"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s3">pred is a predicate, and</span></li>
    <li class="li5"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s3">seq (i.e., "sequence") is a list.</span></li>
    <li class="li5"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s3">(every? pred seq) evaluates to #t when every element of seq satisfies pred, and evaluates to #f otherwise.</span></li>
    <li class="li5"><span class="s5"></span><span class="s1"><br>
</span><span class="s3">What should happen if the list is empty? Justify your answer in a (clearly written) comment. Here's a hint: if seq1 and seq2 are lists, then it should be the case that <br>
<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>(every? pred (append seq1 seq2))</span><span class="s1"><br>
</span><span class="s3">should be the same as (and (every? pred seq1) (every? pred seq2))</span></li>
    <li class="li5"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s3"><br>
Please note: I am asking you for what should happen. So in particular, if you write something like "I tried it out and this is what happened.", your answer is automatically incorrect. I'm looking for clearly expressed reasoning here. You have all had a discrete mathematics course, so you should know what I mean. (Of course if what does happen is not what should happen, something is wrong, either with your reasoning or with your code, right?)</span></li>
  </ul>
  <li class="li6"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s3">Exercise 2.59 (page 153). Call your procedure unordered-union-set.</span></li>
  <li class="li5"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s3">Exercise 2.62 (page 155). Call your procedure ordered-union-set.</span></li>
  <li class="li5"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s3">Define a procedure remove-val which takes two parameters: a value and a list. It returns a list which is the same as the original list except that every element having the given value is deleted. If there are no such elements, the original list is returned. So for instance,</span></li>
